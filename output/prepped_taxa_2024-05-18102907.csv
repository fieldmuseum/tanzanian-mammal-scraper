The ventral fur is paler than the dorsal and varies in color from the light brown to white.  The males have scented white tufts on the shoulders used to attract females.  Of the Epomophorus that occur in Tanzania, this species is one of the largest.  It is one of only two species within the genus with a forearm length that is greater than 67 mm.  The specimens from Tanzania are referred to as E. g. crypturus, and some people treat this group as a separate species, (E. crypturus) (Bergmans, 1988, 1997; Boulay and Robbins, 1989).E. gambianus has an elongated skull due to the long rostrum and palate (",41852,Type Locality,"

Bergmans (1988) identified specimens of this species from Tanzania in only the southeastern corner of the country.Ecological Notes:Found in savannahs, woodlands, and along the forest edge, Epomophorus gambianus is like many bats, it is responsible for the dispersal of seeds and pollination of flowers, and so is an important part of the ecosystem in which it lives (Kingdon, 1984).  E. gambianus roosts either in small group of 12-20 or larger groups of 50 or more (Boulay and Robbins, 1989). They typically perch in various trees like banana, mango and palm, but can also be seen roosting under the eaves of tall buildings (Kingdon, 1984, 1997)Key Reference:1. Bergmans, W., 1988.
