Type Description:
Sitzb. Ges. Naturf. Fr. Berlin, p.123
Type Locality:
Uganda, Ruwenzori region, 'Ukondjo und Kinyawanga'.
Measurements:Head and body: 105-120 mmTail length: 4-5 mmWeight: 26-53 gDescription:There is no visible tail or eyes, the two of the claws on the front foot are well developed, and there is a green, blue or purple metallic sheen on the fur.  This combination of external characters makes this animal unmistakable.Comparisons:No other animal has the combination of characters listed in the description above.Distribution:Chrysochloris stuhlmanni is restricted to the East African montane highlands (Kingdon, 1984, 1997). In Tanzania, C. stuhlmanni occurs in the Uluguru and Udzungwa mountains and the southern highlands in Iringa and Mbeya Regions.Figure 3. Ecological Notes:Found in montane forests (and shambas in the proximity of such habitats) in a variety of central and southwestern Tanzanian mountains, the golden mole burrows, leaving prominent trails of raised earth above their underground paths.  They eat worms and insects.Key Reference:1. Allen, G. M. and Loveridge, A. 1927. Mammals from the Uluguru and Usambara mountains, Tanganyika Territory.

Giant Otter Shrew

Type Description:
Proc. Boston Soc. Nat. Hist., 7:361
Type Locality:
Mountains of the interior, or in the hilly country north and south of the equator, Equatorial Africa [Gabon].
Measurements:Head and body: 290-350 mmTail length: 245-290 mmWeight: 1 kgDescription:Potamogale velox is recognized by the flattened tail that helps it to move through water. The muzzle is flattened, and has many whiskers.  It is brown above and white or yellowish below.  The hind feet are not webbed.Comparisons:The Ruwenzori otter shrew (Micropotamogale ruwenzorii) occurs in Uganda and may be found in Tanzania in the future.  This animal is smaller than Potamogale, the tail is not as flattened, and the digits of the hind feet are webbed. While otters (Aonyx) have the same dorsal color and body form as Potamogale they are bigger and do not have the flattened tail.Distribution:Potamogale velox is found in rivers within the main forest block from Nigeria to W Kenya. This species occurs in large, fast-flowing rivers, streams, sluggish coastal rivers and swamps. It retreats to burrows and crevices on the riferbank to rest and breed. (Kingdon, 1997)Ecological Notes:While this species has not been recorded in Tanzania, it has been observed in countries neighboring Tanzania's northern and western borders and it is possible that Potamogale may be discovered within the country.  Associated with aquatic habitats (including stagnant pools, slow and fast moving streams), this animal is a good swimmer, using its tail for locomotion through water. Potamogale eats crabs, frogs and fish, and lives in holes and tunnels in stream banks.Key Reference:1. Kingdon, J. 1984. East African mammals: An atlas of evolution in Africa.

Type Description:
Rept. Exped. Exploring Central Africa, 1834:42 [1836]
Type Locality:
The country between Lake Latakoo and the Tropic (=South Africa, Northern Cape Province, Kuruman, to S Botswana).
Measurements:Head and body: 110-138 mmTail length: 85-124 mmWeight: 40 gDescription:Elephantulus brachyrhynchus is golden on the top and lighter on the ventral surface.  There is no pectoral gland present, the ears are relatively short and there are no white rings around the eyes.  The tail is shorter than the length of the head and body.
Comparisons:Elephantulus brachyrhynchus differs from the only other species in the genus found in Tanzania, Elephantulus rufescens, in having no gland marked by a spot on the center of the chest, and having a tail that is shorter than the head and body.
Figure 3. Ecological Notes:E. brachyrhynchus lives in holes initially created by rodents in relatively dry habitats, and eats a variety of invertebrates.  These mammals often live in areas frequented by large herbivores.
